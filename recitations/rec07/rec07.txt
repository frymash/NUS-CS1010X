rectangular vs polar complex numbers: which form do we use?

depends on a few factors like
1. time/space complexity
2. what data we have on have


minimum time required for a dense matrix operation is the number of elements
in the matrix. assuming n rows and m columns, the min. time complexity of a 
matrix operation would be O(n*m)

sparse matrices are meant to reduce the number of zeroes in matrices.
given a dense matrix with a ton of zeroes, the sparse matrix will only
include the non-zero entries from the dense matrix.
the min. time complexity of a dense matrix operation would be O(n), where n
is the number of non-zero entries in the matrix

if you multiply a n*m matrix by a m*l matrix, each entry in the product
matrix will take O(m) time to compute. 
given that the product matrix has n*l entries, the net time complexity
required to produce the product matrix is O(m*n*l) => O(n^3)

n^0.0000000000001 vs log n; which produces the lower time complexity

when you see information take a certain form, you cannot immediately decide which
data structure to use. you also need to discern which functions you want to use
on the info, how often you use such functions, and how you want to use/manipulate the info.
once you figure these out, you can
