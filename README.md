# NUS CS1010X - Programming Methodology

* Taken in AY22/23 Semester 2 + ST 1 under Prof Tan Tiow Seng
* The course runs from  9 Jan 2023 to 16 Jun 2023.

## 1. Setting up this repository

Firstly, clone this repository in your machine.
```
git clone git@github.com:ozervesh/NUS-CS1010X.git
```

This repository is packaged with a pre-configured virtual environment that can run Python 3.7.2 (which this course is currently being taught in).

Please remember to activate the virtual environment to use Python 3.7.2 if it is not installed on your machine.
```
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

## 2. Running IDLE

If you install Python 3.7.2 through asdf or are running it through a virtual environment, it may be difficult to find IDLE for Python 3.7.2.
Fortunately, IDLE can be launched via the command line.
``` 
python3 -m idlelib.idle
```
