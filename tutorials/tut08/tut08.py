# (a)
# A widget object can store 2 items.
# You can interact with a widget object in 2 ways:
# 1. You can ask it to insert a new item into its storage.
#    That item will replace the oldest item in storage.
# 2. You can also ask it to retrieve the oldest item in storage. 

# (b)
widget("insert", 1)
widget("insert", 2)
widget("insert", 3)

# (c)
# 2 will always be returned as it will remain the oldest item in storage
# no matter how many retrievals you make (as long as no insertions are
# made in between retrievals).
