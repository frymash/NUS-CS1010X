# (i) print(thrice(thrice)(add1)(6))
# Explanation: The integer 33 would be printed. thrice(thrice) produces
# a function of type (T' -> T') that will compose its input function
# 3^3 (=27) times. As such, thrice(thrice)(add1) will produce a function
# of type (F -> F) that adds 27 to its input number.
# Ultimately, this means that thrice(thrice)(add1)(6) will be equivalent
# to 27 + 6, which evaluates to 33.

# (ii) print(thrice(thrice)(identity)(compose))
# Explanation: thrice(thrice)(identity)(compose) is equivalent to the
# function compose.
#
# The identity function simply returns its input without modifying it.
# This means it will return the same input no matter how many times
# it is composed. This means thrice(thrice)(identity) is
# equivalent to identity. It follows that
# thrice(thrice)(identity)(compose) is equivalent to identity(compose).
# identity(compose) will then return compose.

# (iii) print(thrice(thrice)(sq)(1))
# Explanation: thrice(thrice)(sq) produces a function which returns
# the result of n**2**2**2...(**2 27 times), where n is the float or int
# that will be passed to the function as input.
# When 1 is passed to this function, 1 will also be returned as
# 1 raised to the power of any number will still be 1.

# (iv) print(thrice(thrice)(sq)(2))
# Explanation: Passing 2 to thrice(thrice)(sq) will produce the output
# 2 to the power of 2 27 times. Given that this is an extremely big number,
# the Python interpreter will take a long while before returning the result.

# Your answer here:
# Yes, it is possible to implement new_fib. In order to get the nth Fibonacci
# number with the use of the combine function, the implementation can sum every
# numbers from the 0th Fibonacci number to the nth Fibonacci number.
# After the summation is complete, it must deduct every number from the 0th
# Fibonacci number to the (n-1)th Fibonacci number.
#
# However, given that all terms in the sequence must be combined with the same
# operation (op), the deduction must be recognised as a special case in the new_fib
# function that should only take place after the calculation of the nth Fibonacci
# number. This can be done by defining the helper function f in exactly the same
# manner as the standard fib function before adding the special case.
#
# I have no idea how my new implementation works.
